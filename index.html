    <div class="homepara1">Hello everyone, my name is Mame. After years in the US military and the transportation field,
        In the last two years I dedicated all my time and energy in studying computer with a particular focus in cybersecurity
        and network management. Previously, I worked in the manufacturing industry as an automation technician dealing a lot with
        Industrial Control Systems. Ultimately, The Cyber Defense Education Center at Fayetteville Technical Community College 
       divhas provided me an extensive training in computer network management and cybersecurity.</div>

    <div class="homepara2">With the Cisco Networking Academy, I acquired the skills necessary to design, build, troubleshoot, 
        and secure computer networks. I acquired a strong Knowledge in enterprise-ready Linux thanks to the Red Hat academy. In computer security,
        I acquired the skills necessary to analyze and implement effective and comprehensive information security controls with the use of
        Palo Alto Networks firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), Nessus Tenable vulnerability scanner
        ,Nmap, Wireshark, etc.</div>

    <div class="homepara2">To build this website, I am using HTML and CSS.
        Eventually, I will be using React JS to built a better website in the near future. React JS was released by Facebook in 2013.
        It is open source and free for anyone to build amazing apps and static websites.
        My level in using React JS is quite basic, but like my journey in Cybersecurity I am learning and I find it very fascinating.
        </div>

    <div class="homepara2"> It is a very simple website with just four pages with no ads, ever (I hate ads on websites. 
        Check the Lab page where I detailed how my home lab is setup to block ads). I believe the most interesting page of this website 
        is the Lab page where I will be posting videos showing the work I do in my home lab with Linux OS, Windows OS, Active directory,
        and anything regarding computer and computer security.</div>

    <div class="homepara2">Thank you very much for visiting.</div>
